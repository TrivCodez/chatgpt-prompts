## Goals

**Can we complete our goals? This is a project I've started to work on, I left coding on discord.js v14 and html, css to help developers learn new skills and ensure us developers are not replaced with chatgpt. As an admin in many development servers, I can tell people are using chatgpt incorrectly which is why I've decided to create this repo! I'm updating this frequently when I'm not busy.**
